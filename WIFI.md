# Wi-Fi on the Galaxy S9

The S9's radio is a Broadcom BCM4361 (a module by Murata or Samsung Electro-Mechanics) on PCIe channel 0 of the Exynos
9810. Android drives it with Broadcom's own driver, bcmdhd (GPL), through Samsung's root-complex driver
(`drivers/pci/host/pci-exynos.c`). Neither can come into this tree. The plan is in two stages.

## Stage 1: the link (written, not yet run)

`drivers/wifi/hakios.exynos_pcie.c` in the common repository (`CONFIG_HAKIOS_EXYNOS_PCIE`, built into the S9's kernel,
off until `wifi_pcie=N`). It goes as far as Android's `exynos_pcie_poweron()` does before Linux's PCI core takes over:

| Step | What | Expected on the phone |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | reads only: the PMU's PHY isolation, CMU_FSYS1's gates and Q-channels of the Gen2 controller, the five pins | no gate `CLOSED`; WLAN_REG_ON (gpg0-5) CON 1 or 0, PERST# (gpf2-2) low |
| 2 | PERST# low, CLKREQ# to the controller, WLAN_REG_ON high, 200 ms (Samsung's `dhd_custom_exynos.c`) | `WLAN_REG_ON ... DAT 1` |
| 3 | the PHY out of isolation and power-down, the core's soft reset, PERST# high, the PHY's tables (26 MHz, Gen2), the resets of PCS, PMA, MAC and CDR | `PHY PLL 3` (Samsung's own check calls bits 1:0 set a lock); the core's own ID, not all ones (Android rewrites it to 144d:ecec, this does not) |
| 4 | the root complex set up (x1, Gen2), the LTSSM let go, 20 ms for L0, up to `wifi_pcie_tries` (3) times | `LINK UP after N us (state 11): Gen2 x1` |
| 5 | the endpoint's ID, class and capabilities through the iATU; every BAR sized and placed in 0x11800000-0x127EFFFF | `1:00.0 is 14e4:441f (Broadcom)`, two 64-bit BARs (Broadcom's: 32 KB of registers, then the chip's RAM window, a few MB) |
| 6 | 1:00.0's memory decoding on (command bit 1), and the device handed to stage 2's driver (below) | `command/status now ...0002`; then `brcmfmac:` lines |

Every step says what it does before it does it. A link that does not come up is put back (PERST# low, the LTSSM off,
WLAN_REG_ON low) and the LTSSM's history is printed (32 states, oldest first). Nothing writes a PMIC. A CMU gate that is
closed stops step 3 before the controller is touched; `wifi_pcie_ungate=1` forces it open.

The first runs, one per image, each read from pstore afterwards (README.md, "On the phone"):

```sh
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=1     # a look
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=2     # the radio's power
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=3     # the PHY
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=4     # the link
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=5     # the chip's ID and BARs: stage 1 done
```

Every line of the driver starts with `exynos_pcie:`. What to compare against: Android's own boot log
(`adb shell su -c dmesg | grep -i pcie`) has `exynos_pcie_establish_link: Link up:11` (or similar),
`Current Link Speed is GEN2`, and `lspci`-like facts in `/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/{vendor,device,resource}`.
Read those once from Android before the first run: they are the numbers step 5 should print.

## Stage 2: the radio (written, not yet run)

Linux's **brcmfmac**, Broadcom's ISC-licensed FullMAC driver, on the scheme the POCO's ath11k uses: compiled unmodified
but for one patch, on FreeBSD's LinuxKPI headers and our `wifi/lx`, and tied into one object the kernel links, which
shows only `lx_prepare()`, `lx_start()`, `lx_stop()` and `lx_transmit()`. What is written, in the common repository:

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `tools/mk-brcmfmac.sh` | the twin of `mk-ath11k.sh`: brcmfmac, brcmutil and their headers from the same pinned Linux (7.0.14), every file's ISC licence checked, `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/patches/bcm4361.patch` applied; 24 of brcmfmac's files built (`pcie.c`, `chip.c`, `firmware.c`, `core.c`, `msgbuf.c`, `commonring.c`, `flowring.c`, `fwil.c`, `fweh.c`, `feature.c`, `cfg80211.c`, `p2p.c` and the rest; no SDIO, USB or BCDC); `out/brcmfmac.o`. Only `debug.c`'s three debugfs functions are stubs |
| `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/patches/bcm4361.patch` | the BCM4361 in brcmfmac: PCI device 0x441f in its table; chip IDs 0x4361 and 0x4347 (the chip says one or the other: bcmdhd's `dhd_validate_chipid()`); RAM base 0x170000 for both (`CR4_4347_RAM_BASE`); firmware `brcmfmac4361b0-pcie` for revisions 3 and 4 (B0, B1), `brcmfmac4361b2-pcie` from 5 (B2); and the two lines where `brcmfmac=N` stops it (by returning, leaving things as they are: brcmfmac's way of failing would reset the chip) |
| `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/lx_pci.c` | the `struct pci_dev`: configuration space a word at a time through the kernel, the BARs where stage 1 put them, the PCI driver registered and the device probed as Linux's PCI core would, and the interrupt: INTx from `brcmfmac=5` (below), before that (or with `brcmfmac_poll=1`) brcmfmac's handler called by a thread every `brcmfmac_poll_ms` (2) ms; MSI is off on this root complex |
| `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/lx_cfg.c` | cfg80211 for a FullMAC driver: the wiphy, the network device's registration, the callbacks (`cfg80211_scan_done`, `inform_bss_data`, `connect_done`, `disconnected`), which LinuxKPI leaves empty and `lx_prelude.h` sends here; above them the kernel's station boundary (`sys/hakios.sta.h`, what iOS's Wi-Fi settings ask through `WIFI_STA`), on brcmfmac's `cfg80211_ops` (scan, connect, disconnect, add_key); the four-way handshake by `wifi/lx/src/lx_wpa.c`; frames through the network device's `ndo_start_xmit` and `netif_rx`; and `brcmf_dmi_probe()`, brcmfmac's hook for a board's settings: the phone's address, roaming off |
| `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/lx_rsn.h` | an access point's RSN element read, and ours for the association request (host-tested) |
| `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/lx_kpi.c`, `lx_brcmf.c` | what else brcmfmac asks of LinuxKPI (firmware in the background, a net_device as memory, cfg80211's channel arithmetic), and the steps |
| `drivers/wifi/hakios.brcmfmac.c` (`CONFIG_HAKIOS_BRCMFMAC`) | the kernel's side: the log, the options, the files from `fw/`, memory shown to the chip at its physical address; `lx_os_pci_*()` on `sys/hakios.exynos_pcie.h`; INTx (`lx_os_irq_line_*()`: SPI 253 on the GIC, a thread, the root complex's latch cleared); the phone's address (`wifi_mac`, else `fw/mac.info`, parsed by `sys/hakios.macaddr.h`); the network of `fw/network`; the way back to the loader (`hakios_wifi_stop()`, `hakios_wifi_quiesce()`) |
| `drivers/wifi/hakios.exynos_pcie.c` | `wifi_pcie=6`: memory decoding on, the device handed to the driver; ELBI's INTx enables and latch (`hakios_exynos_pcie_intx()`, `_intx_ack()`); INTx off in `hakios_exynos_pcie_quiesce()`, the chip held in reset and unpowered on the way back |
| `drivers/wifi/hakios.lx.c` (`CONFIG_HAKIOS_LX`) | unchanged, now a driver of its own that both radios' drivers require |
| `tools/brcmfmac-test.py` | host checks: the configuration-space arithmetic; the `.mac.info` parser; the RSN elements (WPA2, mixed, transition taken; WPA3, enterprise, MFP required, TKIP only, WEP refused); for both chip IDs and every revision, the firmware name the patched table gives; the RAM base; the device table; the patch's hooks |

DMA comes from `lx_os_radio_memory()` (44 MB in one physical piece, uncached), shown to the chip at its physical address.

### The steps

`wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=N`, each line said before it is done; every line of this stage starts with `lx:`, `brcmfmac:` or
brcmfmac's own (`brcmfmac_debug=MASK`, `0x180004` by default: INFO, PCIE, FWCON).

| Step | What | Expected on the phone |
|---|---|---|
| `brcmfmac=1` | the pci_dev, brcmfmac's PCI driver and its probe: BAR0 and BAR1 mapped, bus mastering on, the chip's ID and cores through BAR0's window; the firmware is asked for and never given | `lx: pci: 1:00.0 is 14e4:441f, class 0280xx`; `lx: pci: brcmfmac's probe of 1:00.0`; brcmfmac's line for the chip (4361 or 4347, and its revision: 5 for B2) and its cores (ARM CR4, PCIe2 Gen2 rev, ...); `stops before step 2`; `the probe returns 0` |
| `brcmfmac=2` | ... the files asked for and found | `lx: the driver asks for the file "brcm/brcmfmac4361b2-pcie.bin": there` (and `.txt`, `.clm_blob`; `.txcap_blob` is not there and need not be); `stops before step 3` |
| `brcmfmac=3` | ... the firmware and NVRAM into the chip's RAM through BAR1, its processor started, its shared area read, the rings set up | brcmfmac's `Shared RAM addr: 0x...` and `PCIe protocol version` 5 to 7; the firmware's console (`FWCON`) printing its version; `stops before step 4` |
| `brcmfmac=4` | ... the chip's interrupt (a thread that looks), and `brcmf_attach()`: the first command over the rings, which is the first time the chip reads and writes memory (DMA), the events, cfg80211's wiphy | `Firmware: BCM4361/5 wl0: ... version ...`; `lx: cfg80211: band 0: 14 channels`, `band 1: ...`; `the wiphy is registered`; `lx: brcmfmac's interface to the firmware is up` |
| `brcmfmac=5` | ... the interrupt by INTx instead of the thread: SPI 253 (INTID 285) level-triggered on the GIC, ELBI's `PCIE_IRQ_EN_PULSE` (0x00C) to INTA..INTD, the TOE, LEVEL and SPECIAL sources off (Android's `exynos_pcie_enable_interrupts()`); when it fires the SPI is masked, the latch `PCIE_IRQ_PULSE` (0x000) read and written back, brcmfmac's handlers run, the SPI unmasked. `brcmfmac_poll=1` keeps the thread | `brcmfmac: 5: THE GIC'S DISTRIBUTOR IS WRITTEN ...`; `lx: pci: brcmf_pcie_intr's interrupt handler is called when INTx fires`; then the same as 4 (the first command's answer comes by the interrupt) |
| `brcmfmac=6` | ... the phone's address: `wifi_mac=` if given, else `fw/mac.info`, to brcmfmac at its probe; it sets it in the firmware (`cur_etheraddr`) at step 4. Without either, the firmware's own (NVRAM or OTP) | `brcmfmac: 6: the phone's address, from fw/mac.info: xx:xx:xx:..:..:..`; `lx: the network device wlan0 is registered (xx:xx:xx:..)` with the same first three bytes |
| `brcmfmac=7` | ... the station: roaming off; the interface up (brcmfmac's `ndo_open`: the firmware's "up"), en0 on it (iOS's `wlan`), and the station given to the kernel; iOS's Wi-Fi settings scan through it | `lx: the interface wlan0 is up`; `lx: the station is the kernel's to ask: scans; not joining (brcmfmac=8)`; `lx: a scan for the kernel: ... N access points heard in ... ms` |
| `brcmfmac=8` | ... joining: brcmfmac's `connect` (open system, our RSN element, WPA2-PSK with CCMP, the group's CCMP or TKIP), the handshake by `lx_wpa.c`, both keys given (`add_key`), frames both ways; and the network of `fw/network`, if there is one, asked for as soon as the station is there | `brcmfmac: 8: the station is there ...`; `lx: brcmfmac 8: joining the network ...`; `lx: associated, N ms after brcmfmac's connect`; `lx: the handshake: ... its first; answered`, `... its second, SIGNED WITH THE KEY WE HAVE TOO ...`; `both keys given to the firmware: 0`; `lx: THE NETWORK IS JOINED`; `brcmfmac: 8: THE NETWORK OF FW/NETWORK IS JOINED` |

### Who does the handshake

brcmfmac can leave the four-way handshake to the firmware (`BRCMF_FEAT_FWSUP`, the `sup_wpa` iovar) when cfg80211's
connect parameters carry the key (`crypto.psk`). Samsung's bcmdhd for the BCM4361 is built without
`BCMSUP_4WAY_HANDSHAKE` (`bcmdhd_101_12/Makefile`: no chip's flags set it), so `dhd_linux.c` never sets `sup_wpa` and
`wl_cfg80211.c` never offers `NL80211_FEATURE_FW_4WAY_HANDSHAKE`: on the S9, Android's wpa_supplicant does it on the
host, and whether Samsung's firmware has a supplicant at all (`idsup` among its capabilities) is not known. So the
handshake is the kernel's own `lx_wpa.c`, the code that joins networks on the POCO, and brcmfmac is given no key:
it sets `WPA2_AUTH_PSK` with the host's supplicant, as for wpa_supplicant. Message 4 leaves before the pairwise key is
set (brcmfmac waits for it: `brcmf_netdev_wait_pend8021x()`).

### The way back to the loader

Where a run ends in order (`loader_return_after`, the host's `xl stop`, too hot, the battery low: `hakios_wifi_stop()`,
on a thread): if brcmfmac got as far as its interface, `lx_stop()` takes it down (the station taken back, the network
left, the interface down, brcmfmac's removal: the interrupt let go, the chip reset through its watchdog: `lx: brcmfmac
is down again`); then `hakios_exynos_pcie_quiesce()`, the same that `loader_return()` calls on every way back: the root
complex's INTx enables cleared, PERST# low, WLAN_REG_ON low, `exynos_pcie: at the run's end: PERST# low, WLAN_REG_ON low
(reads 0)`. The endpoint's configuration space is not touched (its link may be down by then); PERST# is its reset, which
stops its DMA. After a panic (one processor left, no locks) `hakios_wifi_quiesce()` only masks SPI 253, and
`loader_return()`'s `hakios_exynos_pcie_quiesce()` does the rest.

### The first runs

One image a run, read from pstore afterwards (README.md, "On the phone"). Stage 1 first, as above, up to
`wifi_pcie=5`; then:

```sh
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6                 # hand-over only: "not started (brcmfmac=N)"
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=1      # the chip's ID through BAR0
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=2      # the module from OTP, the files (below)
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=3      # the firmware up
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=4      # its interface: the first DMA
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=5      # INTx in place of the thread
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 60 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=6      # the phone's address (fw-wifi/mac.info)
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 120 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=7     # the station: scan from iOS's Settings
devices/starlte/mkimage.sh -s 120 cpus=2 bootcpu=2 wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=8     # joining (fw-wifi/network, or from Settings)
```

If 5 fails (`Timeout on response` where 4 had none, or no interrupt counted when the driver lets INTx go), add
`brcmfmac_poll=1` to 6 to 8 and go on: the rest does not depend on it.

The kernel has the driver only if `tools/mk-brcmfmac.sh` ran before it was built; one built without says
`THE DRIVER IS NOT BUILT IN`. What to look at when a step fails:

- 1: no line `brcmfmac's probe`: the device table's class match (`0x0280xx`) against what stage 1 read. `brcmf_chip_attach`
  failing: BAR0's window (config 0x80) not taking, or the chip in reset (PERST#, WLAN_REG_ON).
- 2: a file `not there`: `fw/` and VENDOR (below; `ext4:` lines say why VENDOR was not read: `ufs=2` missing, the
  partition's name, a feature). `NO MODULE ID IN THE CIS`: the OTP's words are in the log; the NVRAM is then a guess. If the revision is neither 3, 4 nor 5 and up, there is no line
  for it: the log has the chip's revision, and the patch's table is where to add it.
- 3: `Invalid shared RAM address` or no answer in 5 s: Samsung's firmware not starting under brcmfmac's download (it
  writes a random seed only for `WCC_SEED` chips; bcmdhd's own steps before the download are where to look next).
  `Unsupported PCIE version`: the firmware's msgbuf revision is outside brcmfmac's 5 to 7.
- 4: the first command timing out (`brcmf_msgbuf_query_dcmd: Timeout on response`): the chip cannot reach memory. The
  radio's reads and writes cross the PCIe SysMMU (0x11420000), whose clock (CMU_FSYS1 +0x2098) was off until wifi-a5: a
  read of its registers then stopped the bus (wifi-a4: `Kernel data abort` in `hakios_exynos_pcie_say_dma()`). Step 6 now
  says the data path's gates (`exynos_pcie: 6: the data path: gate ...`), forces the SysMMU's on, says its CTRL and sets
  it to 0 (addresses passed through). `wifi_pcie_coherent=1` also sets SYSREG_FSYS1 +0x700 bits 9:8 (Android's
  use-cache-coherency) and keeps the radio's memory cached; without it the memory is uncached. The driver's state at a
  failed setup is said again on the USB console (`wifi: what the driver said of itself when its setup failed`).
- 5: the first command timing out only with INTx: the chip's INTA does not reach the GIC. The driver's line when it
  lets INTx go counts what arrived and how often the latch held more than INTA; next to look at are ELBI's
  `PCIE_IRQ_PULSE` bits and whether the endpoint's command bit 10 (INTx disable) is set.
- 7: `the interface does not come up`: brcmfmac's `brcmf_cfg80211_up()` (the firmware's "up", power save, the
  regulatory domain); its own lines say which command failed. No access point heard: the CLM blob (`.clm_blob`) and the
  country.
- 8: `associated` and then `the handshake did not finish`: no EAPOL frame came up (`0 messages`) means the firmware
  passes them elsewhere; `NOT GOOD: the MIC ...` means a wrong passphrase. `the association is refused` with a status
  code: our RSN element against the access point's (`lx_rsn.h`). The access point's message 1 again and again, each
  answered (`answered with ours (message 2)`), then `the network is gone (reason 15)`: message 2 did not reach it, or
  its MIC was wrong. Before the first means `failed to expand headroom` (fixed: lx-tx.patch); `lx: msgbuf: frame N on
  flow ring 0: status 0` says the firmware sent it. Then the MIC: the passphrase, or our own address (the network
  device's `registered (00:00:00:..)` was the address left zero, fixed in lx_prelude.h).
- e: `usb: wifi ip: en0's link is up; no IPv4 address yet`: configd's DHCP (`net_test: wifi:` says whether configd has
  its own service for en0); `wifi ping` with no answer: the gateway's address (`wifi ip`), or frames that do not come
  up (`the network is left: N frames sent, M received`).

### What remains

- Roaming (off), power saving, WPA3 and enterprise networks, protected management frames, more than one network.
- The PCIe SysMMU translating (Android's 1:1 table), if step 4 shows the chip cannot reach memory with it passing through.

### The files: firmware, NVRAM, CLM

The project carries them (`firmware/wifi/`, Broadcom's, unchanged, from the LineageOS 24 vendor image: its README has
the sums), and the phone has the same files in its own VENDOR partition. `drivers/wifi/hakios.brcmfmac.c` looks for each
file brcmfmac asks for, in order:

1. under brcmfmac's name (`brcmfmac4361b2-pcie.bin`, `.txt`, `.clm_blob`) in `fw/` of the small image (a developer's
   own `fw-wifi/`, as before);
2. under bcmdhd's name in `fw/` of the small image (`userland/build.sh DEVICE=starlte` puts `firmware/wifi/` there);
3. under bcmdhd's name in the phone's own VENDOR partition, read at run time (`ufs=2`): `/vendor/firmware/` (LineageOS)
   and `/vendor/etc/wifi/` (Samsung's Android). `drivers/storage/hakios.ext4.c` reads it, a read-only ext4 reader on
   `hakios_ufs_read_partition()`; tools/ext4-test.py checks it on images made by mke2fs, and it was run on a copy of this
   phone's own VENDOR (2 Nov, the backup `VENDOR.img`: ext4, 4 KB blocks, extents, 32-byte descriptors): all eight
   radio files read back with the sums of `proprietary-files.txt`. `wifi_vendor=0` leaves VENDOR alone.

| brcmfmac asks for | bcmdhd's name | |
|---|---|---|
| `brcmfmac4361b2-pcie.bin` (`b0` for revisions 3, 4) | `bcmdhd_sta.bin_b2` (`_b0`) | `wifi_fw=<name>` takes another |
| `brcmfmac4361b2-pcie.txt` | the module's NVRAM, below | `wifi_nvram=<name>` takes another |
| `brcmfmac4361b2-pcie.clm_blob` | `bcmdhd_clm.blob` | |

Which NVRAM is this phone's is read from the chip, as bcmdhd reads it (`dhd_custom_cis.c`,
`dhd_parse_board_information_bcm()`): at `brcmfmac=2`, in brcmfmac's probe once the chip is attached and before any file
is asked for, `lx_brcmf_identify()` writes OTP Control 1 (0x18010324) with 0x00fa0000 and the PMU's minimum resources
(0x18012618) with 0x0e4fffff, reading each back, then reads the module's CIS, 22 words from 0x18011110, and the kernel
reads the module's ID from it (`sys/hakios.bcm4361_cis.h`, host-tested by tools/brcmfmac-test.py): its second byte is the
maker (0x33 SEMCO, 0x22 Murata), its first the module's revision, and bcmdhd's tables give the NVRAM:

| Module ID | Module | NVRAM |
|---|---|---|
| 91 33 | SEMCO E32A R02 | `nvram.txt_r02a_b2` |
| a1 33 | SEMCO E32A R02 (Skyworks) | `nvram.txt_r02b_b2` |
| 50, 51, 52, 61 22 | Murata 1QW (bcmdhd's table) | `nvram.txt_murata_r020_b2` ... `_r031_b2`: not in the vendor's files |
| any other 22 | Murata | `nvram.txt_murata_r041_b2`, the vendor's only Murata B2 NVRAM ("Murata 1QW ES4.1") |
| any other 33 | SEMCO | `nvram.txt_r02b_b2` |

The log says which, and whether it was the table's (`as bcmdhd chooses`) or the maker's only one. Without an ID
(`NO MODULE ID IN THE CIS`) the first of the three that is there is taken and called a guess. The same ID chooses
Bluetooth's patch (BLUETOOTH.md).

| Also from the phone | What | |
|---|---|---|
| `/efs/wifi/.mac.info` | the phone's MAC address | `fw-wifi/mac.info`, or boot-arg `wifi_mac=` (`brcmfmac=6`) |
| the network to join | its name and passphrase | `fw-wifi/network` (two lines), or boot-args `wifi_ssid=` and `wifi_psk=`, a byte as `%XX` (a space is `%20`); never logged, but an image made with them carries them, and so does its command line |

Not needed: `bcmdhd_mfg.bin_*` (factory test) and `bcmdhd_mon.bin_*` (monitor mode).

## iOS's side: how the radio reaches Settings

Nothing in iOS's user space changes. The kernel already answers Darwin's Wi-Fi service the way the POCO's radio does,
where Settings scans and joins networks today: brcmfmac's network device is `en0` (`drivers/net/hakios.net.c`, an
Ethernet interface to the kernel), `drivers/wifi/hakios.wlan.cpp` publishes the registry objects `wifid` and
SystemConfiguration look for (an `IO80211Controller` with an `IONetworkInterface` below it, `IO80211InterfaceRole`
"Infrastructure", the address as the `wlan` node's `local-mac-address`), with no user client, so IO80211.framework falls
back to its ioctl path, and `drivers/wifi/hakios.apple80211.c` answers those ioctls (`SIOCGA80211`/`SIOCSA80211`: power,
scan, scan results, associate, the state) from the station boundary (`sys/hakios.sta.h`), which `wifi/lx/brcmfmac/lx_cfg.c`
offers at `brcmfmac=7`. DHCP is configd's own once `en0` is joined. Until the station is offered the toggle is there and
the radio counts as off (what the S9 shows today: no brcmfmac object was linked into its kernels so far, and no
`brcmfmac=`).

## The plan on the phone, stage by stage

One image a stage, each returning to TWRP by itself (`loader_return_after=150`), the log read from pstore afterwards. The
base arguments are the daily image's (README.md); what each stage adds:

| Stage | Adds | Expected in the log | How likely to pass first time |
|---|---|---|---|
| a. the link, the chip's ID | `wifi_pcie=6` | `exynos_pcie: LINK UP after N us (state 11): Gen2 x1`; `1:00.0 is 14e4:441f (Broadcom)`; `brcmfmac: ... chip BCM4361/5` (or 4347/5) with its cores | moderate: the PHY tables and the CMU gates are the first contact with this root complex |
| b. the firmware and its console | `... brcmfmac=4 brcmfmac_poll=1` | `brcmfmac: 2: chip 4361 revision 5 (b2); the module's ID 91 33 (semco) ...: nvram.txt_r02a_b2 (as bcmdhd chooses)`; `ext4: VENDOR:/firmware/bcmdhd_sta.bin_b2: 851300 bytes in N ms`; `Shared RAM addr: 0x...`; the console's `4361b2-roml/config_pcie_release_ipa Version: 13.50.37`; `Firmware: BCM4361/5 wl0: ... 13.50.37`; `lx: brcmfmac's interface to the firmware is up` | lower: DMA through the PCIe SysMMU's default (bypass is assumed) is the open question; Samsung's firmware under brcmfmac's download |
| c. a scan | `... brcmfmac=7 brcmfmac_poll=1` | `lx: the interface wlan0 is up`; `net: en0 attached on ... (a radio)`; `lx: a scan for the kernel: ... N access points heard`; `apple80211:` lines as wifid asks | likely once b passes |
| d. WPA2 to a test network | `... brcmfmac=8`, with `fw-wifi/network` in the image or `wifi_ssid=`/`wifi_psk=` | `lx: associated, N ms after brcmfmac's connect`; both handshake messages; `lx: THE NETWORK IS JOINED` | likely if c passes (lx_wpa.c joins on the POCO) |
| e. DHCP and ping | the same; the USB console's `ping` | configd's lease; replies | likely if d passes |
| f. iOS's UI | the same, without `fw-wifi/network`: Settings, Wi-Fi on, a network chosen, its passphrase typed | the networks listed; the tick; the status bar's fan | likely if e passes (the same surface as the POCO) |

Stages a to c go in one run, image `wifi-a` (`wifi_pcie=6 brcmfmac=7 brcmfmac_poll=1`, the files from the phone's
VENDOR): every step says what it does before it does it, so the log shows where it stopped. `wifi-a-fw` is the same with
`firmware/wifi/` and `firmware/bt/` in `fw/` and `wifi_vendor=0`, for when VENDOR is not read.

If b times out on the first command (`Timeout on response`), the chip cannot reach memory: the PCIe SysMMU (0x11420000)
and SYSREG_FSYS1's I/O coherency are what to look at next (above). If only INTx fails, keep `brcmfmac_poll=1`.

wifi-a5 (`brcmfmac_tcm_idx=1`): step 6 read the SysMMU (CTRL 4, set to 0 for bypass) with its CMU_FSYS1 gate forced on
(00300000), but a later read of its registers from the poller (`hakios_exynos_pcie_say_dma()`, symbolicated) stopped the
bus, a synchronous external abort (`fault_code=0x10`). Since wifi-a6 the SysMMU's registers are left alone unless
`wifi_pcie_mmu_probe=1`; its gate is still forced on, as the radio's DMA may cross it in bypass.

wifi-a6: no abort; DMA both ways (the first ioctl's request read, its acknowledgement written), then `Dongle setup
failed`: no ioctl response buffer had been posted, as brcmfmac's control buffers are 8 KB and the pool's slots were 4 KB
(16 KB slots since). wifi-a7: stages a and b, the CLM loaded, `Firmware: BCM4361/5 wl0: Aug  9 2021 ... 13.50.37`,
`lx: the interface wlan%d is up`, the station offered. wifi-a8: the USB console's `wifi scan` ran brcmfmac's escan, but no
event reached it (`brcmf_escan_timeout: timer expired`): `eth_type_trans()` left the MAC header where brcmfmac looks
for the event. wifi-a9: stage c, `lx: a scan for the kernel: 0 channels named (0: all), asking: 0; 7 access points heard
in 2306 ms`, on 2.4 and 5 GHz, listed by the USB console's `wifi scan`.

Stages d and e (3 Nov, phone 2, a private image with `fw/network` in its ramdisk, `brcmfmac=8 wifi=1`, a WPA2-PSK
network on 5 GHz): wifi-d1 associated (`lx: associated, 222 ms after brcmfmac's connect`), and the access point's message
1 came up, but each message 2 was dropped by brcmfmac (`brcmf_netdev_start_xmit: wlan0: failed to expand headroom`:
LinuxKPI's `skb_header_cloned()` says yes of every buffer and its `pskb_expand_head()` fails; lx-tx.patch). wifi-d3:
message 2 sent (`flow ring 0 made: status 0`, `frame 2 on flow ring 0: status 0`), message 1 again three times, then
reason 15: the MIC. LinuxKPI's `eth_hw_addr_set()` does nothing, so the network device's address, which lx_wpa.c takes
as ours, was zero (`registered (00:00:00:..)`, with `wifi_mac=` too). wifi-d4, with it set:

    lx: the network device wlan0 is registered (08:c5:e1:..:..:..)
    lx: the handshake: a message of 99 bytes from the access point: its first; answered with ours (message 2)
    lx: the handshake: a message of 155 bytes from the access point: its second, SIGNED WITH THE KEY WE HAVE TOO, and with the group's key; answered (message 4)
    lx: the handshake: both keys given to the firmware: 0
    lx: THE NETWORK IS JOINED, 166 ms after brcmfmac's connect: frames pass
    brcmfmac: 8: THE NETWORK OF FW/NETWORK IS JOINED (0, 0)
    net_test: wifi: configd has a network service for en0 after 6.4 s: it configures it itself
    usb: wifi ip: en0's link is up; address 192.168.0.101, mask 255.255.255.0; the default route's gateway 192.168.0.1 on en0
    usb: wifi ping 192.168.0.1: 4 of 4 answered            (4.2 to 6.0 ms)
    usb: wifi ping 1.1.1.1: 4 of 4 answered                (14 to 17 ms)

DHCP is configd's, on the "Wi-Fi" service it makes of the radio's registry objects (`hakios.wlan.cpp`); wifid takes the
link up. The USB console's `wifi ip` and `wifi ping [A.B.C.D]` (the kernel's, `drivers/net/hakios.net.c`) say what en0 was
given and whether the network answers. Next: stage f, Settings (the screen of these runs stayed at the boot logo:
the run's display, not the radio's doing, to be seen with the daily image's ramdisk).
